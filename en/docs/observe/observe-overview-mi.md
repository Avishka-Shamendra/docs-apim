# Observability Overview

Observability can be viewed as a superset of monitoring where monitoring is enriched with capabilities to perform debugging and profiling through rich context, log analysis, correlation, and tracing. Modern day observability resides on three pillars of **logs**, **metrics**, and **tracing**. Modern businesses require observability systems to self-sufficiently emit their current state (overview), generate alerts for any abnormalities detected to proactively identify failures, and to provide information to find the root causes of a system failure.

The Integration observability solutions observe statistics generated by the Integration server. This allows you to analyze the performance of the integration artifacts, monitor the overall health of the integration server and to derive business insights.
