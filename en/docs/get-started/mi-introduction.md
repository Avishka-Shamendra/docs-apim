# Overview

WSO2 Micro Integrator allows you to leverage the integration capabilities to implement any of the following integration strategies.

## Microservices Integration

The Micro Integrator is lightweight and container friendly. This allows you to leverage the comprehensive enterprise messaging capabilities of the Micro Integrator in your decentralized, cloud-native integrations.

If your organization is running on a decentralized, cloud-native, integration architecture where microservices are used for integrating the various APIs, events, and systems, the Micro Integrator can easily function as your Integration microservices and API microservices.

## Centralized Integration (Enterprise Service Bus)

At the heart of the Micro Integrator server is an event-driven, standards-based messaging engine (the Bus). This ESB supports message routing, message transformations, and other types of messaging use cases. If your organization uses an API-driven, centralized, integration architecture, the Micro Integrator can be used as the central integration layer that implements the message mediation logic connecting all the systems, data, events, APIs, etc. in your integration ecosystem.
